Shopify is an e-commerce application just like Amazon or Daraz. It is designed to not only 
facilitate users to buy their favorite items but also to help the buyers to receive orders, 
see the analytics and add new products.

*User module:
First of all the user is asked to either sign in or sign up depending on their status. If the 
user signs up then the email he/she provides will be checked if it exists in the database or not.
If that email is not found in the database then the user will be asked to sign in with theat very 
email and password combination. After successful login, the user will be moved to home screen where 
all the categories and available products will be displayed.

Each category will contain products related to only that categpry. The user can opt for an category 
and can view the image, price and description of that very product. Upon clicking the product, he/she
will move to next screen where details regarding the order will be solicited.

After entering the details, order can be placed by clicking on the button at the bottom saying "Place 
order". If the quantity entered by the user is less than or equal to the available quantity then order
will be placed else an error message will be shown.

*Admin module:
First of all after loging in, admin will be taken to the admin screen which will display the products 
available to be sold. From this screen, admin can perform four functions:
1) View all the products
2) Add a new product
3) View analytics
4) View all the pending orders
If admin wants to add a new product, the plus button on the bottom right corner 
will serve the purpose. After clicking it, he/she will be taken to a new screen which will ask the admin
to enter product image, product name, product price, product quantity, product category and product description.
After enter these the button at the bottom saying "Sell" will be clicked to add that product in the inventory.

If the user wants to view analytics, then clicking the second button on the bottom nav bar will take him/her to
the analytics screen. Here an admin can see the number of orders till now, number of orders this week, number of 
orders this month and number of orders pending.

The last button on the bottom navbar will take the admin to the orders screen, which will display all the 
pending orders with complete information of the buyer.
